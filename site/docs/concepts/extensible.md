# Extensible Data Skipping

!!! note ""
    Read the [IEEE Big Data 2020 paper - Extensible Data Skipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08150)

Xskipper creates a level of abstraction between index creation/query evaluation, and the actual metadata store implementation, which is unique to each metadata store.

This abstraction operates in two main areas:

1. [Indexing Flow](indexing-flow.md) - abstract metadata is generated during index creation and refresh by analyzing a DataFrame.

2. [Query Evaluation Flow](query-evaluation-flow.md) - abstract metadata clauses are generated by filters that analyze the Catalyst (Spark optimizer) expression tree for pushdown predicates, and identify subtrees that can be mapped to a metadata Clause.

These abstract structures (MetaData and Clauses) are then translated to a representation that matches a specific metadata store. Metadata Clauses can then be applied to MetaDataTypes in an efficient manner.
